If you can, do those in our Issue Tracker Repository, by creating an issue it&amp;rsquo;ll give you those exact options that I mentioned in the question.
You can also use this Discord Server:
Use &amp;ldquo;feature-request&amp;rdquo; channel to request features or give ideas. Use &amp;ldquo;bugs-crashlogs&amp;rdquo; channel to report bugs and game crashes.
You can also use our forum</description></item></channel></rss>
